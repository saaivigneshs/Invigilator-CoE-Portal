# **_Automation in Invigilation Duty ✨_**

Invigilation duty is a crucial and time-consuming task that requires careful coordination and management. The existing manual process often leads to confusion and inefficiencies, especially when it comes to staff availability and addressing last-minute queries. Moreover, managing all the records manually makes it difficult to make changes or updates in real-time.

To address these challenges, we have developed a web application called "Automation in Invigilation Duty" that streamlines and automates the invigilation process. This user-friendly and interactive system simplifies the entire invigilation workflow, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. 🚀

## **Key Features 📋**

Faculty Registration 🎓: The first step is the faculty registration process. Faculty members can easily create their accounts, providing the necessary information.

**Exam Hall Information 🏫**: Our web application maintains a comprehensive database of exam halls, including their seating capacity, equipment availability, and other essential details.

**Student List 📝**: The system also manages the list of students appearing for exams, allowing for easy access and reference.

**Invigilator Assignment 🧑‍🏫**: Each exam hall is assigned a designated invigilator from the available pool. This assignment is done automatically by the system based on the hall's requirements and invigilator availability.

**Real-time Notifications 📲**: Invigilators receive direct notifications 30 minutes before the exam starts, ensuring they are well-prepared and present at their assigned exam halls promptly.

**Biometric Attendance 🖐️**: We have implemented a biometric system for invigilators. Before the exam, invigilators are required to register their biometrics, ensuring accurate attendance tracking. This system helps avoid any last-minute rush or confusion.

**Faculty Attendance 🎯**: By linking the faculty's daily biometric data, our system tracks and ensures the attendance of faculty members during invigilation duties.

**Automated Reminders ⏰**: A reminder email is sent one day prior to the exam to notify faculty members of their invigilation duty for the following day.

**Student Portal 📚**: Students have their own portal where they can access information about their assigned exam halls and table allotments, providing them with a clear understanding of the examination layout.
